As of September 2<sup>nd</sup> I’ll be employed as a front end developer at [Valtech](http://www.valtech.se), and I’m super excited.

Valtech is a technology and marketing digital agency with offices in all four corners of the world, from Seoul to New York. Personally I’ll be working from Stockholm.

I’ve been working at [byBrick Interface](http://www.bybrick.se/en/our-business-areas/interface) for three and a half years now, and even if I’m still enjoying every minute of it …   

## … All good things must come to an end.

[byBrick](http://bybrick.com) has been a fantastic work place for me. Almost everything I know I’ve been able to learn through my projects here and nothing seems to be impossible for this company.

Because it’s not only IT but also design, 3D, management and infrastructure I’ve had the opportunity to be exposed to lots of people and technologies that I otherwise might not have. And this is really important when you’re in the beginning of your career (hey, I’m not even 30 yet).

I’m walking away from byBrick ambivalent. Of course I’m very happy and glad to be joining Valtech (that seems to be a fantastic company with some amazingly talented people) and at the same time I’m sad that I won’t be working with my fantastic colleagues *and friends* here at byBrick any more.
