With an approach that is always design-driven, I create user-friendly, robust design systems for websites and mobile-native apps.

I am currently working at [Hem](https://www.hem.com/)â€”a Stockholm-based independent design brand creating a new generation of furniture, accessories and lighting. Before Hem, I helped bring positive impact to the lives of children and youths through sports at [Heja](https://heja.io/), played a part shaping the GPS vehicle fleet tracking world at [Automile](https://automile.com/) and worked with various clients such as Sveriges Radio, TV4, GE, and ABB at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/sv-se/) and [byBrick](https://www.bybrick.se/).

Despite my current position, I'm am always curious about new challenges through collaborations and freelance opportunities. Reach out at <david@davidpaulsson.se>
