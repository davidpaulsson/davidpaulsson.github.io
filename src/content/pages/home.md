With an approach that is always design-driven, I create user-friendly, robust design systems for websites and mobile-native apps.

I am currently working at [Heja](https://heja.io/)—a sports tech startup with a passion for the positive impact sports can play in the lives of children and youths: encouraging healthy lifestyles, building lasting friendships, growing children into leaders and acting as a bridge between cultures. Before Heja, I’ve helped shape the GPS vehicle fleet tracking world at [Automile](https://automile.com/) and worked with various clients such as Sveriges Radio, TV4, GE, and ABB while having a position as an Interface Developer at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/sv-se/) and Digital Designer at [ByBrick](https://www.bybrick.se/).

Besides work, I'm running a boutique shop [House of Paulsson](https://houseofpaulsson.se/) together with my wife and two kids, where we sell details for your plants, cuttings, and leaves. Despite my current position, I'm am always curious about new challenges through collaborations and freelance opportunities. Reach out at <david@davidpaulsson.se>
