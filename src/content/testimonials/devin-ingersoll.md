David and I have worked together as a small team for two years now and it has been such a pleasure to manage Hemâ€™s tech and online store with him. David always takes a customer-first approach to his work and effortlessly challenges the status quo to guarantee the best experience for our end users. He adds fun and spontaneity to his work (coming up with new exciting ideas and quickly rolling them out) which creates joy for those around him. He is collaborative, strategic, and thoughtful all while producing top quality work. I feel lucky to be able to work with him!
