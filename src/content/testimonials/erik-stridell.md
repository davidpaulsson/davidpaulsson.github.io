I found David's profile here on LinkedIn and jumped at the chance to hire him. Since then, he has been the cornerstone of the social media services at our agency and has excellent skills in both digital design and development. He is always up to date with the web and has strong opinions, which is remarkable since he tends to be right. :) Excellent guy to have around!
